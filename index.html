                    <strong>Precise Location Data:</strong>
                    GPS location coordinates collected approximately every

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Usage and Activity Data:</strong>
                    Clock-in and clock-out timestamps, sales entries (such as

            <h2>3. Location Data Usage Disclosure</h2>
            <p>
                The Groovy Sales Agent App collects precise location data as a
                core functional requirement.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Location data is collected only while the user is actively
                    logged in and clocked in during work hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Location data may be collected in both foreground and
                    background modes to ensure accurate field activity
                    verification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Location tracking automatically stops when the user clocks
                    out or logs out of the App.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The App does not track location outside of work hours or
                    during off-duty periods.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                personal tracking.

            <p>
                Denying required permissions may limit or prevent the App from
