                <strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 30, 2025
            </div>

            <p>
                Enhaz Beverages Pvt Ltd ("we," "us," "our," or the "Company"),
                operating under the brand name <strong>Groovy</strong>, is committed
                to protecting the privacy of our employees and sales agents.
                This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and
                protect personal information through the Groovy Sales Agent
                mobile application (the "App").
            </p>

            <p>
                The App is an internal business tool designed exclusively for
                in-house sales agents and field employees to support
                attendance tracking, sales reporting, and location verification
                during work hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                By accessing or using the App as part of your employment,
                you acknowledge and consent to the practices described in this
                Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                We collect only the information necessary to operate the App
                effectively:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Account and Login Information:</strong>
                    User credentials provided and managed by authorized company
                    administrators. The App does not support self-registration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Location Data:</strong>
                    Precise GPS location collected approximately every 30 seconds
                    while you are logged in and clocked in. This data is used
                    strictly to verify field presence during active work shifts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Usage and Activity Data:</strong>
                    Clock-in/clock-out timestamps, sales entries (such as visits,
                    orders, and notes), and limited device information (e.g.,
                    device identifier and IP address) required for system
                    functionality and reporting.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We do not collect sensitive personal information such as financial
                details, health data, or personal contacts.
