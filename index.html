    <h1>Groovy Sales Agent App Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 30, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Enhaz Beverages Pvt Ltd ("we," "us," "our," or "Company"), operating under the brand name Groovy, is committed to protecting the privacy of our employees and sales agents. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information through the Groovy Sales Agent mobile application (the "App"). The App is an internal tool designed exclusively for our in-house sales agents and field employees to facilitate clock-in/clock-out, sales tracking, and location monitoring during work hours.</p>

    <p>By using the App as part of your employment, you acknowledge and consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following information to enable the App's core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account and Login Information</strong>: Username and password (or other credentials) provided by your employer or admin. Accounts are created and managed externally by admins (no self-registration in the App).</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: Precise GPS location coordinates collected every 30 seconds while you are logged in and clocked in. This is used solely to verify your presence in the field during work shifts.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Clock-in/clock-out timestamps, sales entries (e.g., visits, orders, notes), and device information (e.g., device ID, IP address) for app functionality and reporting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect unnecessary personal data, such as financial information, health data, or contacts.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information is used only for legitimate business purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To track attendance and work hours.</li>
        <li>To verify field agent locations and routes for sales monitoring.</li>
        <li>To generate sales reports and performance insights.</li>
        <li>To ensure compliance with company policies and improve operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Location tracking is active only during clocked-in shifts and is not used for any non-work-related purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing or other purposes. Data may be accessed by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authorized company admins and managers for work-related reviews.</li>
        <li>Service providers (e.g., AWS for secure hosting) under strict confidentiality.</li>
        <li>As required by law or to protect company rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement strong security measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS.</li>
        <li>Stored securely on AWS servers with access controls.</li>
        <li>Regular monitoring and industry-standard protections against unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as necessary for business and legal purposes (e.g., attendance records, sales history). Data is deleted or anonymized when no longer required.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access or correct your data.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your account and associated data (including location history).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at the details below. Requests will be processed promptly (typically within 30 days), subject to employment and legal requirements.</p>

    <h2>7. Consent and Employment Context</h2>
    <p>Use of the App is part of your employment role. By logging in and using the App, you consent to this data collection for work purposes.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. Changes will be posted here with a new effective date.</p>
